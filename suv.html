    <p align="justify">The Lamborghini Urus is a high performance luxury SUV manufactured by Italian automobile
        manufacturer Lamborghini. It was introduced in December 2017 as a 2018 model year production vehicle.[4] The
        Urus is the first Lamborghini SUV and five-door vehicle in the modern era (under the ownership of Volkswagen
        Group), and the second SUV in the brand's history after the LM002, which was produced between 1986 and 1993.

        Built on the Volkswagen Group MLB Evo platform, the Urus shares many components with other Volkswagen Group
        luxury SUVs, such as the Audi Q7, Bentley Bentayga, Porsche Cayenne, and Volkswagen Touareg. With a top speed of
        312 km/h (194 mph), the Urus SE is the fastest production SUV in the world.[5]

        The name comes from the urus, the ancestor of modern domestic cattle, also known as the aurochs.[6]</p>
    <br><br><br>
    <div>
        <h2>Specifications and performance</h2>
        <hr>
        <p align="justify">The Lamborghini Urus is significantly lighter than many of its competitors (i.e. the BMW X6
            M, Bentley Bentayga and Rolls-Royce Cullinan, but not the Porsche Cayenne) at less than 2,200 kg (4,850 lb)
            as quoted by the manufacturer[17] mainly because of the extensive usage of carbon fibre reinforced polymer,
            despite using the same platform as the Audi Q7, Bentley Bentayga, Porsche Cayenne, and Volkswagen
            Touareg.[18]

            The Urus has a front-engine, all-wheel-drive layout,[18][19] and a top speed of 305 km/h (190 mph) making it
            one of the world's fastest production SUVs. The Urus can accelerate from 0–100 km/h (62 mph) in 3.6 seconds
            and 0–200 km/h (124 mph) in 12.8 seconds.

            Lamborghini has developed the world's largest set of carbon ceramic disc brakes for the Urus at the time of
            its release, with 440 mm (17.32 in) discs in the front and 370 mm (14.57 in) discs in the rear using
            ten-piston callipers at the front and single-piston calipers at the rear.[20] The all-wheel drive system of
            the Urus under normal driving sends 40 percent of the available torque to the front wheels and 60 percent to
            the rear wheels. It also uses torque vectoring to send as much as 70 percent to the front or 87 percent to
            the rear, when necessary. The SUV also features rear-wheel steering and an air suspension system that can
            provide a maximum of 250 mm (9.8 in) of ground clearance for off-road use. The SUV is available with an
            optional off-road package, which includes modified front and rear bumpers that are better suited to the
            task.

            An unadorned Urus comes standard with a turbocharged 4.0-litre V8, an eight-speed ZF 8HP automatic
            transmission, all-wheel drive, 21-inch wheels, carbon-ceramic brakes, a rear-axle torque-vectoring system,
            and four-wheel steering. On the inside, the Urus comes with a simulated suede headliner and leather seating
            surfaces. The front seats feature 12-way power adjustment, position memory, seat heating, and a 12.3-inch
            digital instrument panel. The rear seats can be configured as either a three-person bench or two-person
            sport seats, and four-zone automatic climate control is standard.[21]

                alt="V8 engine" hspace="20" height="200px" align="right">
            The Urus, like all of Lamborghini's current offerings, features a selection of driving modes, which adapt
            the suspension to improve the car's performance in various driving conditions. The Lamborghini Urus features
            Strada (street), Sport, Corsa (track), Terra (dirt), Sabbia (sand), and Neve (snow) driving modes, with the
            latter three possibly only available on the off-road package offered. The Urus has a seating capacity of
            four to five people.[22]
        </p>
        <h3>Powertrain</h3>
        <p align="justify">The Urus does not use Lamborghini's hallmark of naturally aspirated V10 (as used in the concept) or V12
            engines. Instead, the Urus is powered by a 4.0-litre twin-turbocharged V8, a modified version of Audi's
            4.0-litre V8. The engine is rated at a maximum power output of 478 kW (641 hp; 650 PS) at 6,000 rpm and
            maximum torque of 850 N⋅m (627 lb⋅ft) at 2,250–4,500 rpm. The engine has been heavily reworked for the Urus,
            and is uprated by 100 PS (74 kW; 99 hp) and 80 N⋅m (59 lbf⋅ft) of torque more than the Cayenne Turbo, with
            changes such as new cylinder heads. The engine is assembled at a Volkswagen plant in Hungary and is shipped
            to Lamborghini's assembly plant.[23][24]

            The Urus accelerates from 0 to 62 mph (100 km/h) in 3.6 seconds and reaches a top speed of 190 mph (306
            km/h). The EPA fuel economy is rated at 14 mpg‑US (16.8 L/100 km; 16.8 mpg‑imp) combined (city and highway),
            12 mpg‑US (19.6 L/100 km; 14.4 mpg‑imp) city, and 17 mpg‑US (13.8 L/100 km; 20.4 mpg‑imp) highway.[2</p>

        <h2>Special variants</h2>
        <hr>
        <p align="justify">
        <h4>Urus Pearl Capsule</h4>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/2021_Lamborghini_Urus_Pearl_Capsule.jpg"
            alt="Urus Pearl Capsule" align="right" hspace="20" height="150px">

        The Urus Pearl Capsule is a variant of the standard Urus. Customers who buy the Urus Pearl Capsule can customize
        it to the fullest, with options including being able to choose the colours for two-tone Alcantara seats, to the
        paint colours. Lamborghini states that there are three pearl paint options available—Verde Mantis, Arancio
        Borealis and Giallo Inti—providing a modern interpretation of the original solid colours united with Lamborghini
        tradition. The Black Gloss is painted lower bumpers, rocker covers and roof to create a dramatic two-tone
        effect, while the 23-inch Taigete alloy wheels in Shiny Black match the colour accents chosen. Technical
        specifications of the Urus Pearl Capsule such as power and torque remain the same as the standard Urus.[26]

        <h4>Urus ST-X</h4>
        The Urus ST-X is a racing, non-street-legal variant of the standard Urus, built by the Squadra Corse Division of
        Lamborghini. The concept was unveiled in 2018, at the Lamborghini World Finals. Designed to meet FIA
        regulations, the production ST-X features a full roll-cage, fire suppression system, and an FT3 fuel tank. The
        air intakes have been enlarged to better optimize the heat exchange of the 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8. Power and
        torque remain the same as the street-legal Urus, with the same 641 hp (650 PS) and 850 N⋅m (627 lb⋅ft) of
        torque. The car has hexagonal racing exhausts, and 21-inch alloy wheels fitted with Pirelli tires. These changes
        give a 25% weight reduction compared to the street-legal car. Customer deliveries are scheduled for 2020.[27]

        <h4>Urus Performante</h4>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Lamborghini_Urus_Performante_1X7A6803.jpg"
            alt="Urus Performante" align="right" hspace="20" height="150px">

        The Urus Performante was unveiled by Lamborghini in August 2022 as a more powerful variant of the Urus. Unlike
        other special variants, the Performante saw a significant change in design and performance specifications. The
        engine is upgraded to produce 657 hp (666 PS; 490 kW), with torque remaining unchanged, and it comes with
        improved downforce, while being 104 lb (47 kg) lighter than other variants.[28] Lamborghini claims a 0–100 km/h
        (62 mph) time of 3.3 seconds and a top speed of 306 km/h (190 mph).[29] Other changes include retuned
        suspension, a more rear biased center differential, removal of the height adjustable air springs in favor of
        fixed height coil springs, removal of the off-road drive modes, and optional Pirelli P Zero Trofeo R tires.[30]

        <h4> Urus SE</h4>
        The SE, revealed in April 2024, features a general restyling of the exterior part. However, the turning point in
        this version is the new Plug-in hybrid system, which, coupled with the 611 HP twin-turbo V8 already adopted on
        the basic model, increases the power up to 789 HP, with 950 Nm of torque. Despite the weight, which has
        increased by 300 kg compared to the Urus S, the SE has slightly better acceleration from 0 to 100 km/h,[31] but
        the big difference lies in emissions: According to Lamborghini, the Urus SE has an 80% lower environmental
        impact, compared to older versions of the SUV.[32]
