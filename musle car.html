    <p align="justify">The Dodge Challenger is the name of three generations of automobiles produced by the American
        automobile manufacturer Dodge. However, the first use of the Challenger name by Dodge dates back to 1959 for
        marketing a "value version" of the full-sized Coronet Silver Challenger. <br>

        From model years 1970 to 1974, the first-generation Dodge Challenger pony car was built using the Chrysler E
        platform in hardtop and convertible body styles sharing significant components with the Plymouth Barracuda.

        The second generation, from model years 1978 to 1983, was a badge engineered Mitsubishi Galant Lambda /
        Sapporo, a coupe version of an economical compact car. <br>

        The third and current generation is a full-size muscle car that was introduced in early 2008 initially as a
        rival to the evolved fifth generation Ford Mustang and the fifth generation Chevrolet Camaro. <br>

        In November 2021, Stellantis announced that the 2023 model year would be the final model year for both the LD
        Dodge Charger and LA Dodge Challenger, as the company will focus its plans on electric vehicles rather than
        fossil fuel-powered vehicles, due to tougher emissions standards required by the Environmental Protection Agency
        for the 2023 model year. Challenger production ended on December 22, 2023, and the Brampton, Ontario,
        assembly plant will be re-tooled to assemble an electrified successor.</p> <br> <br>

    <p align=" justify">The E-body Challenger was introduced in the autumn of 1969 for the 1970 model year, similar
        in appearance to but somewhat larger than its less expensive, platform-sharing Plymouth sibling, the Barracuda.
        It was positioned to compete against the Mercury Cougar and Pontiac Firebird in the upper end of the pony car
        market, a large and lucrative niche of two-door sport coupes that the Ford Mustang had pioneered in April
        1964. Like the Barracuda, it was available in a wide variety of trim and option levels. In spite of its
        premium price, size, and market placement, Chrysler intended the new Challenger to be the most potent pony car
        ever, and virtually every engine in its inventory (including the famed 426 Hemi) was made available. <br>

        While the vehicle was all new, Dodge had used the Challenger name in 1959 for the Silver Challenger, a
        limited-production two-door coupe based on the fourth-generation Dodge Coronet. <br>

        The 1970 Challenger's longer wheelbase, larger dimensions, and more luxurious interior than the Mustang or its
        smaller Chrysler products stablemate, the Barracuda, were prompted by the launch of the upscale 1967 Mercury
        Cougar, a bigger, better appointed, and more expensive pony car aimed at affluent young American buyers. The
        110 in (2,800 mm) wheelbase was 2 in (51 mm) longer than the Barracuda's, and the Dodge differed in its sheet
        metal, much as the Cougar differed from the shorter-wheelbase Mustang. Air conditioning and a rear window
        defogger were optional. With 1971 being the sole exception, the front ends of both cars differed from each
        other in that the Challenger had four headlights and the Barracuda had only two. <br>

        The exterior design was penned by Carl Cameron, who was also responsible for the exterior designs of the 1966
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c7/1970ChallengersixpackGreen.jpg/1920px-1970ChallengersixpackGreen.jpg"
            alt="CHALLENGER" height="105px" hspace="20" align="right">
        Dodge Charger. Cameron based the 1970 Challenger grille on an older sketch of a stillborn 1966 Charger prototype
        that was to have a turbine engine. The pony car segment was already declining by the time the Challenger
        arrived. Sales were excellent intitially, with 76,925 units moved in the model's debut year, but fell
        dramatically after 1970. Though sales rose for the 1973 model year with over 27,800 cars being sold, Challenger
        production ceased midway through the 1974 model year. A total of 165,437 first-generation Challengers were sold.

    <p align="justify">Beginning with the 1978 model year, Dodge marketed a rebadged variant of the early Mitsubishi
        Galant Lambda coupe as the Dodge Challenger — through Dodge dealers as a captive import, initially as the "Dodge
        Colt Challenger". Chrysler's Plymouth brand marketed its rebadged variant as the Plymouth Sapporo, and a
        rebadged variant was marketed overseas as the Mitsubishi Sapporo/Scorpion and sold.
        <br>
        The Sapporo and Challenger were redesigned in 1981 with revised bodywork with increased footroom, headroom,
        trunk capacity, and soundproofing. Both cars were marketed until 1983, when they were replaced by the
        Conquest using the same rear-wheel-drive platform through 1989, and in 1984 by the front-wheel-drive Laser and
        Daytona. <br>

        The car retained the frameless hardtop styling of the old Challenger, but had smaller engines, a 1.6 L
        inline-four and a 2.6 L inline-four instead of the slant-6 and V8 engines of the original Challenger models. The
        engines were rated at power outputs of 77–105 hp (57–78 kW). Mitsubishi pioneered the use of balance shafts
        to help damp engine vibrations.

        alt="3rd gen" align="left" height="250px" hspace="20">
    <p align="justify">In late 2005, Dodge teased spy photos of the third-generation Dodge Challenger prototype on the
        internet, which
        was announced on November 21, 2005, with an official sketch of the vehicle. The Dodge Challenger Concept was
        unveiled at the 2006 North American International Auto Show; production started in 2008. Many design cues of the
        Dodge Challenger Concept were adapted from the 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T.</p>
    <p>For the 2019 model year, Dodge released new high-performance versions of the Challenger, trimmed the line-up down
        to six models, and made numerous other tweaks and changes. The model line-up for 2019 includes the following
        trims: SXT, GT, R/T, R/T Scat Pack, SRT Hellcat, and SRT Hellcat Redeye. Both SXT and GT models are now
        available in both rear and all-wheel drive, with the GT previously having been the only model available in AWD.
        GTs gain a more aggressive look with a performance hood, front splitter, steering and suspension while
        maintaining the optional performance handling group which includes wider wheels, performance summer tires,
        4-piston Brembo brakes, and fixed-rate Bilstein suspension. The SXT model loses the performance handling group
        as an option, lacks the more aggressive exterior upgrades of the GT and has less aggressive gearing, making it
        the cheaper economical alternative. R/T Scat Pack models come with a new power-bulge aluminum hood standard.
        Shared with the SRT Hellcat, this hood features dual air extractors that cool the engine and help reduce lift.
        For 5.7L and 6.4L V8 R/T models, the rear seats can be deleted at the cost of $1 and have a net weight savings
        of 55&nbsp;lbs. In addition, a second level of the performance handling group called the "performance plus
        package" is offered, providing 20 x 9.5-inch low-gloss black forged wheels, 275/40ZR20 Pirelli P Zero summer
        tires, and a limited-slip differential in addition to the upgrades found in the performance handling group which
        remains unchanged since its introduction in 2018.</p>
    <p> Following the discontinuation of the Demon, the Redeye was developed to fill the void. Essentially a heavily
        upgraded Hellcat, the Redeye is equipped with a slightly less powerful (due to a smaller hood intake system)
        Demon engine: a supercharged 6.2L V8 rated at 797&nbsp;hp (594&nbsp;kW; 808&nbsp;PS) and 707&nbsp;lb⋅ft
        (959&nbsp;N⋅m; 98&nbsp;kg⋅m) of torque, an increase of 90&nbsp;hp (67&nbsp;kW; 91&nbsp;PS) and 11&nbsp;lb⋅ft
        (15&nbsp;N⋅m; 2&nbsp;kg⋅m) over the standard Hellcat engine. Other upgrades include reinforced ZF 8 speed
        automatic transmission, track-tuned suspension, torque Reserve and 41-spline heavy-duty half-shafts, SRT power
        chiller, and after-run chiller.

    <p align="justify">The Challenger was introduced to the SCCA Trans Am Series in 1970. Two factory-backed cars were
        prepared by Ray Caldwell's Autodynamics and driven by Sam Posey and Tony Adamowicz. The No.77 car was built at
        Autodynamics from a street Challenger T/A taken from a local dealer showroom. The No.76 chassis arrived
        mid-season from Dan Gurney's All-American Racers and was completed by Autodynamics.

    <ul>
        <li>Dodge's early to mid-1970s factory-supported "Kit Car" program for short-track late-model stock car racing
            offered a choice of Challenger, and a few (less than 12) were made. Still, in 1974, Dodge ended the
            Challenger
            line, and they went to the Dodge Dart Sports and Dodge Aspen bodies over a steel-tube chassis.</li>
        <li>
            Blackforest Motorsports has currently entered a Challenger in the Continental Challenge.</li>
        <li>The Challenger R/T has been used as the Chrysler model for starting in 2010 NASCAR Nationwide Series
            competition.</li>
    </ul>
    With Dodge officially out of NASCAR at the end of the 2012 season, the remaining cars and racing parts have been
    bought up by "privateer" racing teams and continue to show up in Nationwide Series during the 2013 and 2014
    seasons. J. J. Yeley indicated his two-car team would continue to field a Challenger in the series for as long
    as he can find parts to keep the cars running. The team stopped after the 2014 season after his No. 93 (later
    No. 28) regularly ran in the top 20 during races. However, the Mike Harmon-owned No. 74, and the Derek
    White-operated No. 40 qualified and ran Dodges in 2015. Mike Harmon Racing ran a Dodge the entire season and
    also did so in 2016, and has raced in over half of the 2017 season so far. Likewise, White's MBM Motorsports
    team fielded the Nos. 13 and 40 as Dodges in some races. MBM continues to field Dodges into 2018 with Timmy
    Hill in the 66 (was the 13). <br>

    In late 2014, two Challengers fielded by Miller Racing with the support of SRT and Mopar, driven by Cameron
    Lawrence and Joe Stevens, started racing in the Trans-Am Series TA2 class. Both cars used a spec Howe road
    racing tube chassis with fiberglass bodies. Powered by a Hemi 392 slightly modified for road racing extremes and
    restricted by class rules, the cars made around 500 horsepower. Except for the slightly bulged fenders and a
    large rear wing, the cars look much like the stock/street version despite being roughly 7/8s the size of the
    road car. Lawrence won four of the twelve races in the 2015 season, finishing third overall in the Trans Am TA2
    championship. <br>

    Joe Stevens in the No. 11 "Green Car" finished sixth overall after fourth place at the season finale at Daytona
    International Speedway. Joe Stevens also received the Cool Shirt Hard Charger award for his excellent rookie
    season performance. For the 2016 season, the Stevens-Miller Team fielded three Challengers in the TA2 series and
    ran in 16 events, scoring a few wins. The No. 77 car was painted in a throw-back scheme similar to the 1970 No.
    77 car driven by Sam Posey. The No. 12 car occasionally fielded a blue scheme paying tribute to the Plymouth
    Cuda Trans-Am car driven by Swede Savage. <br>

    In March 2017, the Challenger returned to compete at Sebring after a nearly 40-year absence from Trans-Am's
    fastest racing class TA class in Tra. Jeff Hinkle drove it under the American V8 Road Racing team with John
    Debenedictis as crew chief. The car was orange and purple with stripes of many of the other challenger colors to
    celebrate the current stable of cars for the street. It is powered by a Penske Engines Mopar R5 / P7 carbureted
    engine producing 855 hp (638 kW). In its debut, it qualified 16th and finished 9th out of 24. <br>

    At all Superbike World Championship races in the United States, Fiat's Alfa Romeo safety car is replaced with
    Chrysler's Dodge Challenger. <br></p>
