    <p align="justify">The BMW M4 is a high-performance version of the BMW 4 Series automobile developed by BMW's
        motorsport division, BMW M, that has been built since 2014. As part of the renumbering that splits the coupé
        and convertible variants of the 3 Series into the 4 Series, the M4 replaced those variants of the BMW M3.
        Upgrades over the standard BMW 4 Series include an upgraded engine, suspension, exhaust system, brakes and
        weight reduction measures including increased use of carbon fiber, such as on the roof of the car.[1] </p>

    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/2017_BMW_M4_Competition_Package_3.0_Front.jpg/1920px-2017_BMW_M4_Competition_Package_3.0_Front.jpg"
        alt="" height="200px" align="right" hspace="20">
    <p align="justify">On 25 September 2013, BMW released the technical specifications of the M4. It is powered by
        the S55B30 engine, which is developed and engineered by BMW M GmbH. This 3.0-litre inline-6 engine has been
        built specifically for the new M4/M3, having a redline of 7,600 rpm with the rev limiter actuated at 7,300
        rpm. The engine uses two mono-scroll turbochargers with a peak boost pressure of 18.1 psi (1.2 bar). The
        power is rated at 317 kW (431 PS; 425 hp), however this is achieved not at a specific engine speed, but is
        instead rated throughout the range of 5,500–7,300 rpm. The engine's torque is rated at 550 N⋅m (406 lbf⋅ft)
        throughout the range of 1,850–5,500. Two transmission choices are available, the 6-speed manual and the
        7-speed M-DCT transmissions. The 7-speed M-DCT transmission accelerates the car from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph
        in 4.1 seconds) and the 6-speed transmission from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.3 seconds.[3] The
        weight of the European specification M4 equipped with a manual transmission is 1,572 kg (3,466 lb) and with
        the M-DCT dual-clutch transmission, the car is some 40 kg (88 lb) heavier, losing some 80 kg (176 lb) as
        compared to the E92 M3.[4]

        As per its E92 predecessor, the roof of the coupe model is constructed from carbon fiber (except if the
        optional sunroof is fitted).[5] Carbon fiber is also used for the boot lid and engine brace.[6] For the
        first time in a M3/M4 model, an electric power steering unit is used.[7] The steering system is specifically
        tuned for both the M3 and M4, however it has been criticized for lacking in feel.[8] The 18 inches (460 mm)
        and 19 inches (480 mm) wheel options are available with lightweight forged alloy wheels being standard. The
        M compound brakes come standard (with blue brake calipers), while carbon ceramic brakes (with gold brake
        calipers) are available as an option.

        The M4 features Active Sound, live amplification of the engine's natural sound inducted into the passenger
        cabin via speakers in the car. BMW claims this technology has been used so that the well insulated cabin can
        reduce road/wind noise but still provide the driver with the sporty sound of the M powered engine. There are
        no artificial sound or any pre-recorded track in the system. This system was first implemented in the M5
        (F10).

        The M4 is based on the F32 4 Series[9] however 50 percent of its components are unique as compared to the 4
        Series.[10]

        The convertible variant of the M4 was announced along with its coupe sibling, also internally known as F82
        or F83 M4. It shares almost everything with the coupé version, but weighs more due to its folding metal
        roof.[11] The convertible weighs 1,750 kg (3,858 lb) (manual), 1,691 kg (3,728 lb) (M-DCT). The three-piece
        retractable hardtop folds in 20 seconds.[12] The only significant difference between the two is the weight
        due to its retractable hardtop. Like its hardtop counterpart, the F83 M4 uses carbon fiber reinforced
        plastic to lighten and stiffen the car.

        Because of its extra weight it accelerates slower, taking it 0.3 seconds longer to 100 km/h (62 mph); 4.9
        seconds with the manual and 4.4 seconds with the M-DCT transmission. The dynamic differences between the two
        variants are marginally small.[13][14]

        Starting from the 2019 model year (production from 07/2018 onward) BMW removed the carbon fiber driveshaft
        so as to be able to fit an Otto Particulate Filter (OPF), necessary to comply with WLTP emissions
        regulations and this also meant that the M Performance Exhaust was no longer able to be offered on these
        cars by BMW.[15]</p>
    <h3>Design Variants / Editions</h3>
    <hr>
    <h4>M4 Competition Package</h4>
    <p align="justify">In February 2017, BMW announced the M4 Competition Package. The M4 Competition Package increases
        power output by
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/2017_BMW_M4_Competition_Package_S-A_3.0_Front.jpg"
            alt="bmw m4" height="180px" hspace="20" align="LEFT">
        14 kW (19 PS; 19 hp) to 331 kW (450 PS; 444 hp) and has a revised suspension for better handling.[16] New
        springs, dampers and anti-roll bars complement the included Adaptive M Suspension. BMW also re-tuned the
        electronic differential and the Dynamic Stability Control to match the upgraded hardware. The interior remains
        largely unchanged, but Competition Package cars get new lightweight sport seats along with the M-striped woven
        seat belts. The exterior includes the M Sport exhaust with black chrome tailpipes and high gloss Shadow Line
        exterior trim. Gloss black trim is added to the kidney grille, side gills, and model badge on the trunk.[17]
    </p>

    <p align="justify"> With the Competition Package, the coupe version accelerates from standstill to 100 km/h (62 mph)
        in 4.0 seconds.

        There is a convertible version, and that does the run in 4.2 seconds, both coupé and convertible forms using the
        dual-clutch transmission.[17]</p> <br><br>
    <h4>M4 GTS</h4>
    <hr>
    <p align="justify">
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/M4gts-pb-001_0.jpg" alt="" height="180px"
            hspace="20" align="right">
        BMW introduced the M4 GTS concept in August 2015 at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance.[18] In 2016, BMW
        introduced the production version of the car which was a track-focused version of the standard M4 coupé itself
        with a limited production run of 700 units.

    </p>
    <p align="justify">The M4 GTS is powered by the same 2,979 cc (3.0 L; 181.8 cu in) twin-turbocharged straight-six
        engine as in the
        standard M4, but the power output has been raised by 51 kW (69 PS; 68 hp) to 368 kW (500 PS; 493 hp) at 6,250
        rpm and 600 N⋅m (443 lb⋅ft) of torque at 5,500 rpm largely due to a nozzle water injection system that is the
        first to be used on a production automobile in almost twenty years.[19] In addition to the increased engine
        power, the M4 GTS is 27 kg (60 lb) lighter than the standard M4 Coupé with the DCT transmission, so the weight
        now stands at 1,585 kg (3,494 lb). The M4 GTS features new OLED taillights (a BMW first), a stripped and
        weight-reduced interior with a full roll cage (half roll cage for North American markets), fiberglass cabin to
        trunk divider, removed soundproofing material, titanium exhaust system, a manually-adjusted three-way suspension
        by KW suspensions, and multi-way adjustable carbon fiber splitter and wing that can add up to 63 pounds front
        and 210 pounds rear downforce at 300 km/h.[20][21][22]

    </p>
    <p align="justify">The 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) acceleration time is reduced to 3.8 seconds, while the top speed
        stands at 305 km/h
        (190 mph). The M4 GTS has, according to BMW, lapped the infamous Nürburgring Nordschleife track in 7 minutes and
        28 seconds – 24 seconds faster than the base M4 and 20 seconds faster than the M3 GTS.

    <H2>Second generation (G82/G83; 2020)</H2>
    <hr>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/2021_BMW_M4_Competition.jpg/1920px-2021_BMW_M4_Competition.jpg"
        alt="" height="150px" hspace="20" align="LEFT">
    <p align="jsutify">The second iteration of the BMW M4 (codenamed G82) is largely based on the standard 4 Series (G22
        generation), which was previewed by the BMW Concept 4. It is a high performance version of the standard G22 4
        Series. Prototypes of the BMW M4 have been seen tested on the Nürburgring beside the G80 BMW M3. The first units
        were assembled in November 2020, with global deliveries starting in early 2021.[32]

        The more notable upgrades for the G82 M4 is a power output of 473 HP which is a 35 kW (47 hp; 47 hp) increase
        over the previous M4, as well as adopting the twin-kidney grille from the 4 Series.[33] <br>

        The convertible version of the new M4 was introduced in May 2021. Like the standard new-generation BMW 4 Series
        Convertible, the M4 Convertible (internal designation G83) has a folding soft top. It normally opens/closes in
        18 seconds, at speeds up to 50 km/h (31 mph). The convertible is available as a Competition model with the M
        xDrive. Top speed is electronically limited to 250 km/h (155 mph), but with the optional M Driver's Package, it
        can increase to 280 km/h (174 mph). As for acceleration on 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph), it is 3.6 seconds. <br>

        For the North American market, only the manual transmission will be available in the standard M4 while the M4
        Competition only is available with an automatic transmission.
        For the Thailand market, the manual transmission will be available in the standard M4,[34] while the automatic
        transmission will be available in the M4 Competition.[35]

        For the Philippine market, only the automatic transmission will be available in the M4 Competition.</p>
    <h3>M4 Competition</h3>
    <hr>
    <p align="justify">At launch in 2020, the M4 Competition model was unveiled alongside the standard M4 model. Compared to the
        standard M4, the M4 Competition increases power output by 22 kW (30 PS; 30 hp) to a total of 375 kW (510 PS; 503
        hp) and torque is increased by 100 N⋅m (74 lb⋅ft) to 650 N⋅m (479 lb⋅ft), and it is offered exclusively with an
        8-speed M Steptronic Sport automatic transmission. The M4 Competition also features a separate transmission oil
        cooler, black chrome exhaust tips, forged M light-alloy wheels, automatic brake hold function, and high-gloss
        black mirrors.[36][37]</p>
    <h4>xDrive</h4>
    <p align="justify">Competition models equipped with xDrive are significantly quicker from 0-60 mph when compared to RWD models,
        clocking in at just 2.8 seconds,[38] as compared to 3.6 seconds for RWD.[39]</p>
    <h4>M4 CS</h4>
    <p align="justify">BMW has announced the all-new 2025 BMW M4 CS, which features a more powerful version of the S58 6-cylinder twin
        turbo engine that has 543 hp, a 20 hp increase over the normal BMW M4 Competition, BMW also said that the M4 CS
        weighs 77 pounds less than a M4 Competition xDrive, all of these new improvements make it go from 0 to 100kph in
        just 3.4 seconds. The BMW M4 CS Base MSRP starts at $123,500[40]

        The CS also arrives with a specially tuned chassis that features revised wheel camber settings and anti-roll
        bars intended to improve handling; a cast aluminum strut brace increases torsional rigidity. BMW also
        recalibrated the adaptive dampers and the electrically assisted steering system.[41]

        BMW claimed it recorded a 7:21:99 lap time around the Nürburgring Nordschleife track.[41][42]</p>

    Kith logo. Exterior-wise the car is fully matte black, silver and white.[44]
    
    <h4>M4 CSL</h4>
    At the 2017 Frankfurt Auto Show, head of BMW's M division Frank Van Meel announced that the CSL nameplate would be
    making a return, replacing the GTS in the performance model monikers.[45] On May 4 of 2022, BMW announced that the
    M4 CSL would debut at the 2022 Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este.[46] Changes include significant weight reduction of
    around 200 lb (91 kg), hence the CSL name, which stands for Coupe Sport Leichtbau (Lightweight Sport Coupe), a large
    front carbon fiber front splitter, a ducktail rear spoiler, more horsepower, 543 hp (551 PS; 405 kW).[47][48] Only
    1,000 units were made.[49]
    <h4>3.0 CSL</h4>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/2022_BMW_M4_CSL.jpg/1920px-2022_BMW_M4_CSL.jpg" alt=""height="180px" hspace="20" align="right">
    On 24 November 2022, BMW revealed its all-new BMW 3.0 CSL with a more powerful 3.0-liter Inline-six cylinder engine
    which generates a power of 412 kW (560 PS; 553 hp) and 550 N⋅m (406 lb⋅ft) of torque. BMW is celebrating BMW M's
    50th Anniversary, so on the occasion of M's 50 Anniversary, the new 3.0 CSL will be produced in only 50 units.[50]
    All CSL cars were fully handmade at the BMW Stuttgart plant.

    <h4>BMW M 50 Jahre</h4>
    In Europe and other selected sales regions, BMW M GmbH is offering the "M4 Edition 50 Jahre BMW M" to mark its
    anniversary. The exclusive two-door Coupé comes in the BMW Individual exterior colours Carbon Black, Macao Blue,
    Brands Hatch Grey, Imola Red and San Marino Blue. The production number was limited to a total of 700 units for the
